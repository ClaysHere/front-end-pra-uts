                The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal and a
                baleen whale. Reaching a maximum confirmed length of 29.9 meters
                (98 ft) and weighing up to 199 tonnes (196 long tons; 219 short
                tons), it is the largest animal known ever to have existed. The
                blue whale's long and slender body can be of various shades of
                greyish-blue dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath. Four
                subspecies are recognized: B. m. musculus in the North Atlantic
                and North Pacific, B. m. intermedia in the Southern Ocean, B. m.
                brevicauda (the pygmy blue whale) in the Indian Ocean and South
                Pacific Ocean, B. m. indica in the Northern Indian Ocean. There
                is also a population in the waters off Chile that may constitute
                a fifth subspecies.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                In general, blue whale populations migrate between their summer
                feeding areas near the poles and their winter breeding grounds
                near the tropics. There is also evidence of year-round
                residencies, and partial or age/sex-based migration. Blue whales
                are filter feeders; their diet consists almost exclusively of
                krill. They are generally solitary or gather in small groups,
                and have no well-defined social structure other than mother-calf
                bonds. The fundamental frequency for blue whale vocalizations
                ranges from 8 to 25 Hz and the production of vocalizations may
                vary by region, season, behavior, and time of day. Orcas are
                their only natural predators.

              <p>
                The blue whale was once abundant in nearly all the Earth's
                oceans until the end of the 19th century. It was hunted almost
                to the point of extinction by whalers until the International
                Whaling Commission banned all blue whale hunting in 1966. The
                International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed blue
                whales as Endangered as of 2018. It continues to face numerous
                man-made threats such as ship strikes, pollution, ocean noise
                and climate change.

              <br />
              <p>
                The genus name, Balaenoptera, means winged whale while the
                species name, musculus, could mean "muscle" or a diminutive form
                of "mouse", possibly a pun by Carl Linnaeus when he named the
                species in Systema Naturae. One of the first published
                descriptions of a blue whale comes from Robert Sibbald's
                Phalainologia Nova, after Sibbald found a stranded whale in the
                estuary of the Firth of Forth, Scotland, in 1692. The name "blue
                whale" was derived from the Norwegian "bl√•hval", coined by Svend
                Foyn shortly after he had perfected the harpoon gun. The
                Norwegian scientist G. O. Sars adopted it as the common name in
                1874.

              <br />
              <p>
                Blue whales were referred to as 'Sibbald's rorqual', after
                Robert Sibbald, who first described the species. Herman Melville
                called the blue whale "sulphur bottom" in his novel Moby Dick
                because of the accumulation of diatoms creating a yellowish
                appearance on their pale undersi

              <p>
                At least four subspecies of blue whale are recognized, some of
                which are divided into population stocks or "management units".
                They have a worldwide distribution, but are mostly absent from
                the Arctic Ocean and the Mediterranean, Okhotsk, and Bering Sea.

              <p style="width: 100%">Northern subspecies (B. m. musculus)</p>
              <br />
              <p>
                North Atlantic population - This population is mainly documented
                from New England along eastern Canada to Greenland, particularly
                in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, during summer though some
                individuals may remain there all year. They also aggregate near
                Iceland and have increased their presence in the Norwegian Sea.
                They are reported to migrate south to the West Indies, the
                Azores and northwest Africa.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Eastern North Pacific population - Whales in this region mostly
                feed off California from summer to fall and then Oregon,
                Washington State, the Alaska Gyre and Aleutian Islands later in
                the fall. During winter and spring, blue whales migrate south to
                the waters of Mexico, mostly the Gulf of California, and the
                Costa Rica Dome, where they both feed and breed.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Central/Western Pacific population - This stock is documented
                around the Kamchatka Peninsula during the summer; some
                individuals may remain there year-round. They have been recorded
                wintering in Hawaiian waters, though some can be found in the
                Gulf of Alaska during fall and early winter.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Northern Indian Ocean subspecies (B. m. indica) - This
                subspecies can be found year-round in the northwestern Indian
                Ocean, though some individuals have recorded travelling to the
                Crozet Islands during between summer and fall.

              <p style="width: 100%">Pygmy blue whale (B. m. brevicauda)</p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Madagascar population - This population migrates between the
                Seychelles and Amirante Islands in the north and the Crozet
                Islands and Prince Edward Islands in the south were they feed,
                passing through the Mozambique Channel.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Australia/Indonesia population - Whales in this region appear to
                winter off Indonesia and migrate to their summer feeding grounds
                off the coast of Western Australia, with major concentrations at
                Perth Canyon and an area stretching from the Great Australian
                Bight and Bass Strait.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Eastern Australia/New Zealand population - This stock may reside
                in the Tasman Sea and the Lau Basin in winter and feed mostly in
                the South Taranaki Bight and off the coast of eastern North
                Island. Blue whales have been detected around New Zealand
                throughout the year.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Antarctic subspecies (B. m. intermedia) - This subspecies
                includes all populations found around the Antarctic. They have
                been recorded to travel as far north as eastern tropical
                Pacific, the central Indian Ocean, and the waters of
                southwestern Australia and northern New Zealand.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Blue whales off the Chilean coast may be a separate subspecies
                based on geographic separation, genetics, and unique song types.
                Chilean blue whales may overlap in the Eastern Tropical Pacific
                with Antarctica blue whales and Eastern North Pacific blue
                whales. Chilean blue whales are genetically differentiated from
                Antarctica blue whales and are unlikely to be interbreeding.
                However, the genetic distinction is less with the Eastern North
                Pacific blue whale and there may be gene flow between
                hemispheres.
